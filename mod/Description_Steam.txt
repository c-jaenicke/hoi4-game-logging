[h1]Analyse your games![/h1]

[hr][/hr]

This mod adds a decision to the game that automatically fires every month. When it fires, it writes country attributes to a file. After that you can run a script that parses the created file and turns it into a CSV file that can be imported into a excel like application and turned into graphs.

The logged attributes include:
[list]
    [*] number of divisions
    [*] amount of infantry equipment
    [*] amount of ships
    [*] manpower
    [*] fuel
    [*] number light tank divisions
    [*] number medium tank divisions
    [*] numbers heavy tank divisions
[/list]

More might be added in the future.
